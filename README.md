## robotics nanodegree home service project.
Final Project for robotics nano degree

Create a home service robot that picks a package and delivers it.

#### Packages used:

To complete this project I used the following packages:

* `turtlebot_gazebo`: I used this package to work with turtlebot in my world.
* `turtlebot_rviz_launchers`: This package is used to show the robot and navigation data in rviz.
* `actionlib`, `move_base_msgs`: These packages are used to move the robot toward the pickup and dropoff locations.
* `visualization_msgs`: This package is used to create virtual objects in rviz simulation.
* `nav_msgs`: This package is used to subscribe to odometry
